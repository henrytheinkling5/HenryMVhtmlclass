			<p>Local mountain bikers have been wanting to improve their local mountain bike park and decide to fix it up. The group of volunteers built and donated multiple obstacles and cleaned up the trails.
				We interviewed one of the volunteers to see what he had to say about the improvements. <b>Tony Stark</b> <q>We spent about a month building all these parts in a couple people garages before carrying them 
				Up to the park to install all the parts. The hardest part of this process was getting permits from the city to install all of features.</q> Its incredible what these volunteers have done for the 
				community by redoing the park, the young kids in the town are definitely going to enjoy this park. </p>
			<p> Now we are going to go in depth about the process the volunteers used to make the features that were added to the park. The first step was seeing how much space they had to work with to plan all of their 
				features. The next part was to figure out what features they wanted to build. After figuring out what features they wanted to build they designed the features by either drawing them or using computer
				assisted design. After the design was finished they could build the features in multiple parts. After they finished the parts they took the pieces to the park and the specific spot the feature was supposed to go and and completely built the feature. 
				Then they <strong>rigorously</strong> tested the feature to make sure it was fun and safe to ride.
